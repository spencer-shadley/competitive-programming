# Competitive Programming

### About
 * These are my solutions to various coding problems from [CodeForces.com](http://codeforces.com)
 * Each file corresponds to one codeforces problem
 * You can find more information about the problem using the provided link in the comment at the top of each file

### Purpose
 * Review various algorithms
 * Polish my Java skills
 * Interview practice

### Problems
 * Buttons: A greedy dfs algorithm. If you enjoy The Matrix, check out this thinly veiled reference of red and blue button clicking.
 * Dijkstra: Undirected weighted shortest path graph problem. You'll never guess which algorithm I chose to solve this.
 * Maze: A dfs algorithm. Create a complex labyrinth worthy of even the smartest hamsters.
 * Palindrome: Simple palindrome checker. Add a char and see if your string remains a valid palindrome. String fun!
 * Missiles: Extreme dijkstra problem
 * SinkPlates: dfs algorithm to help you optimize cleaning dishes.
